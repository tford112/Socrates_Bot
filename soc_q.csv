“Employ your time in improving yourself by other men’s writings so that you shall come easily by what others have labored hard for.”“Well I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance.

Which is better? Only God knows.”“To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know.
