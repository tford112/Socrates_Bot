Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher who made a huge impact on Western logic and philosophy, was born around470 BC, in Athens, Greece. Although we know little about his life except for the information recorded by his students, including Plato, what we do know makes it clear that he had a unique and powerful philosophy and personality.Socrates was son of Sophroniscus, a stone mason and sculptor, and Phaenarete, a midwife. Because he was not from a aristocraticfamily, he most likelyreceived a basic Greek education and learned his father’s craft at a young age prior to devoting his life to philosophy.Socrates married Xanthippe and hadthree sons—Lamprocles, Sophroniscus and Menexenus.Socrates believed that philosophy wouldachieve bring aboutresults for the greater well-being of society. He aimedto establish an ethical system based on human reason by pointing out that human choices were motivated by the desire for happiness, and that wisdom comes fromintrospection.While someAthenians admired Socrates’ challenges to conventional Greek wisdom, manyfelt he threatened away of life that had worked for ages. So when the political climate of Greece turned, Socrates was sentenced to death by hemlock poisoning in 399 BC and accepted hisjudgment.These Socrates quotes are still an inspiration and very much thought provoking to people of all ages today.
